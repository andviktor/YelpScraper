Selenium Wire
=============

Selenium Wire extends `Selenium's <https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/>`_ Python bindings to give you access to the underlying requests made by the browser. You author your code in the same way as you do with Selenium, but you get extra APIs for inspecting requests and responses and making changes to them on the fly.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install using pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install selenium-wire

If you get an error about not being able to build cryptography you may be running an old version of pip. Try upgrading pip with ``python -m pip install --upgrade pip`` and then re-run the above command.

Browser Setup
-------------

No specific configuration should be necessary except to ensure that you have downloaded the relevent webdriver executable for your browser and placed it somewhere on your system PATH.

- `Download <https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/>`__ webdriver for Chrome
- `Download <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/>`__ webdriver for Firefox
- `Download <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/>`__ webdriver for Edge

OpenSSL
-------

Selenium Wire requires OpenSSL for decrypting HTTPS requests. This is probably already installed on your system (you can check by running ``openssl version`` on the command line). If it's not installed you can install it with:

**Linux**

.. code:: bash

    # For apt based Linux systems
    sudo apt install openssl

    # For RPM based Linux systems
    sudo yum install openssl

    # For Linux alpine
    sudo apk add openssl

**MacOS**

.. code:: bash

    brew install openssl

**Windows**

No installation is required.

Creating the Webdriver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that you import ``webdriver`` from the ``seleniumwire`` package:

.. code:: python

    from seleniumwire import webdriver

Then just instantiate the webdriver as you would if you were using Selenium directly. You can pass in any desired capabilities or browser specific options - such as the executable path, headless mode etc. Selenium Wire also has it's `own options`_ that can be passed in the ``seleniumwire_options`` attribute.

.. code:: python

    # Create the driver with no options (use defaults)
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()

    # Or create using browser specific options and/or seleniumwire_options options
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(
        options = webdriver.ChromeOptions(...),
        seleniumwire_options={...}
    )

.. _`own options`: #all-options

Note that for sub-packages of ``webdriver``, you should continue to import these directly from ``selenium``. For example, to import ``WebDriverWait``:

.. code:: python

    # Sub-packages of webdriver must still be imported from `selenium` itself
    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

**Remote Webdriver**

Selenium Wire has limited support for using the remote webdriver client. When you create an instance of the remote webdriver, you need to specify the hostname or IP address of the machine (or container) running Selenium Wire. This allows the remote instance to communicate back to Selenium Wire with its requests and responses.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'addr': 'hostname_or_ip'  # Address of the machine running Selenium Wire. Explicitly use 127.0.0.1 rather than localhost if remote session is running locally.
    }
    driver = webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor='http://www.example.com',
        seleniumwire_options=options
    )

If the machine running the browser needs to use a different address to talk to the machine running Selenium Wire you need to configure the browser manually. `This issue <https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire/issues/220>`_ goes into more detail.

Accessing Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selenium Wire captures all HTTP/HTTPS traffic made by the browser [1]_. The following attributes provide access to requests and responses.

``driver.requests``
    The list of captured requests in chronological order.

``driver.last_request``
    Convenience attribute for retrieving the most recently captured request. This is more efficient than using ``driver.requests[-1]``.

``driver.wait_for_request(pat, timeout=10)``
    This method will wait until it sees a request matching a pattern. The ``pat`` attribute will be matched within the request URL. ``pat`` can be a simple substring or a regular expression. Note that ``driver.wait_for_request()`` doesn't *make* a request, it just *waits* for a previous request made by some other action and it will return the first request it finds. Also note that since ``pat`` can be a regular expression, you must escape special characters such as question marks with a slash. A ``TimeoutException`` is raised if no match is found within the timeout period.

    For example, to wait for an AJAX request to return after a button is clicked:

    .. code:: python

        # Click a button that triggers a background request to https://server/api/products/12345/
        button_element.click()

        # Wait for the request/response to complete
        request = driver.wait_for_request('/api/products/12345/')

``driver.har``
    A JSON formatted HAR archive of HTTP transactions that have taken place. HAR capture is turned off by default and you must set the ``enable_har`` `option`_ to ``True`` before using ``driver.har``.

``driver.iter_requests()``
    Returns an iterator over captured requests. Useful when dealing with a large number of requests.

``driver.request_interceptor``
    Used to set a request interceptor. See `Intercepting Requests and Responses`_.

``driver.response_interceptor``
    Used to set a response interceptor.

**Clearing Requests**

To clear previously captured requests and HAR entries, use ``del``:

.. code:: python

    del driver.requests

.. [1] Selenium Wire ignores OPTIONS requests by default, as these are typically uninteresting and just add overhead. If you want to capture OPTIONS requests, you need to set the ``ignore_http_methods`` `option`_ to ``[]``.

.. _`option`: #all-options

Request Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request objects have the following attributes.

``body``
    The request body as ``bytes``. If the request has no body the value of ``body`` will be empty, i.e. ``b''``.

``cert``
    Information about the server SSL certificate in dictionary format. Empty for non-HTTPS requests.

``date``
    The datetime the request was made.

``headers``
    A dictionary-like object of request headers. Headers are case-insensitive and duplicates are permitted. Asking for ``request.headers['user-agent']`` will return the value of the ``User-Agent`` header. If you wish to replace a header, make sure you delete the existing header first with ``del request.headers['header-name']``, otherwise you'll create a duplicate.

``host``
    The request host, e.g. ``www.example.com``

``method``
    The HTTP method, e.g. ``GET`` or ``POST`` etc.

``params``
    A dictionary of request parameters. If a parameter with the same name appears more than once in the request, it's value in the dictionary will be a list.

``path``
    The request path, e.g. ``/some/path/index.html``

``querystring``
    The query string, e.g. ``foo=bar&spam=eggs``

``response``
   The `response object`_ associated with the request. This will be ``None`` if the request has no response.

``url``
    The request URL, e.g. ``https://www.example.com/some/path/index.html?foo=bar&spam=eggs``

``ws_messages``
    Where the request is a websocket handshake request (normally with a URL starting ``wss://``) then ``ws_messages`` will contain a list of any websocket messages sent and received. See `WebSocketMessage Objects`_.

Request objects have the following methods.

``abort(error_code=403)``
    Trigger immediate termination of the request with the supplied error code. For use within request interceptors. See `Example: Block a request`_.

``create_response(status_code, headers=(), body=b'')``
    Create a response and return it without sending any data to the remote server. For use within request interceptors. See `Example: Mock a response`_.

.. _`response object`: #response-objects

WebSocketMessage Objects
------------------------

These objects represent websocket messages sent between the browser and server and vice versa. They are held in a list by ``request.ws_messages`` on websocket handshake requests. They have the following attributes.

``content``
    The message content which may be either ``str`` or ``bytes``.

``date``
    The datetime of the message.

``from_client``
    ``True`` when the message was sent by the client and ``False`` when sent by the server.

Response Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Response objects have the following attributes.

``body``
    The response body as ``bytes``. If the response has no body the value of ``body`` will be empty, i.e. ``b''``. Sometimes the body may have been compressed by the server. You can prevent this with the ``disable_encoding`` `option`_. To manually decode an encoded response body you can do:

.. code:: python

    from seleniumwire.utils import decode

    body = decode(response.body, response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', 'identity'))


``date``
    The datetime the response was received.

``headers``
     A dictionary-like object of response headers. Headers are case-insensitive and duplicates are permitted. Asking for ``response.headers['content-length']`` will return the value of the ``Content-Length`` header. If you wish to replace a header, make sure you delete the existing header first with ``del response.headers['header-name']``, otherwise you'll create a duplicate.

``reason``
    The reason phrase, e.g. ``OK`` or ``Not Found`` etc.

``status_code``
    The status code of the response, e.g. ``200`` or ``404`` etc.


Intercepting Requests and Responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As well as capturing requests and responses, Selenium Wire allows you to modify them on the fly using interceptors. An interceptor is a function that gets invoked with requests and responses as they pass through Selenium Wire. Within an interceptor you can modify the request and response as you see fit.

You set your interceptor functions using the ``driver.request_interceptor`` and ``driver.response_interceptor`` attributes before you start using the driver. A request interceptor should accept a single argument for the request. A response interceptor should accept two arguments, one for the originating request and one for the response.

Example: Add a request header
-----------------------------

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request):
        request.headers['New-Header'] = 'Some Value'

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # All requests will now contain New-Header

How can I check that a header has been set correctly? You can print the headers from captured requests after the page has loaded using ``driver.requests``, or alternatively point the webdriver at https://httpbin.org/headers which will echo the request headers back to the browser so you can view them.

Example: Replace an existing request header
-------------------------------------------

Duplicate header names are permitted in an HTTP request, so before setting the replacement header you must first delete the existing header using ``del`` like in the following example, otherwise two headers with the same name will exist (``request.headers`` is a special dictionary-like object that allows duplicates).

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request):
        del request.headers['Referer']  # Remember to delete the header first
        request.headers['Referer'] = 'some_referer'  # Spoof the referer

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # All requests will now use 'some_referer' for the referer

Example: Add a response header
------------------------------

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request, response):  # A response interceptor takes two args
        if request.url == 'https://server.com/some/path':
            response.headers['New-Header'] = 'Some Value'

    driver.response_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # Responses from https://server.com/some/path will now contain New-Header

Example: Add a request parameter
--------------------------------

Request parameters work differently to headers in that they are calculated when they are set on the request. That means that you first have to read them, then update them, and then write them back - like in the following example. Parameters are held in a regular dictionary, so parameters with the same name will be overwritten.

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request):
        params = request.params
        params['foo'] = 'bar'
        request.params = params

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # foo=bar will be added to all requests

Example: Update JSON in a POST request body
-----------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import json

    def interceptor(request):
        if request.method == 'POST' and request.headers['Content-Type'] == 'application/json':
            # The body is in bytes so convert to a string
            body = request.body.decode('utf-8')
            # Load the JSON
            data = json.loads(body)
            # Add a new property
            data['foo'] = 'bar'
            # Set the JSON back on the request
            request.body = json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')
            # Update the content length
            del request.headers['Content-Length']
            request.headers['Content-Length'] = str(len(request.body))

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

Example: Basic authentication
-----------------------------

If a site requires a username/password, you can use a request interceptor to add authentication credentials to each request. This will stop the browser from displaying a username/password pop-up.

.. code:: python

    import base64

    auth = (
        base64.encodebytes('my_username:my_password'.encode())
        .decode()
        .strip()
    )

    def interceptor(request):
        if request.host == 'host_that_needs_auth':
            request.headers['Authorization'] = f'Basic {auth}'

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # Credentials will be transmitted with every request to "host_that_needs_auth"

Example: Block a request
------------------------

You can use ``request.abort()`` to block a request and send an immediate response back to the browser. An optional error code can be supplied. The default is 403 (forbidden).

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request):
        # Block PNG, JPEG and GIF images
        if request.path.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.gif')):
            request.abort()

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # Requests for PNG, JPEG and GIF images will result in a 403 Forbidden

Example: Mock a response
------------------------

You can use ``request.create_response()`` to send a custom reply back to the browser. No data will be sent to the remote server.

.. code:: python

    def interceptor(request):
        if request.url == 'https://server.com/some/path':
            request.create_response(
                status_code=200,
                headers={'Content-Type': 'text/html'},  # Optional headers dictionary
                body='<html>Hello World!</html>'  # Optional body
            )

    driver.request_interceptor = interceptor
    driver.get(...)

    # Requests to https://server.com/some/path will have their responses mocked

*Have any other examples you think could be useful? Feel free to submit a PR.*

Unset an interceptor
--------------------

To unset an interceptor, use ``del``:

.. code:: python

    del driver.request_interceptor
    del driver.response_interceptor

Limiting Request Capture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selenium Wire works by redirecting browser traffic through an internal proxy server it spins up in the background. As requests flow through the proxy they are intercepted and captured. Capturing requests can slow things down a little but there are a few things you can do to restrict what gets captured.

``driver.scopes``
    This accepts a list of regular expressions that will match the URLs to be captured. It should be set on the driver before making any requests. When empty (the default) all URLs are captured.

    .. code:: python

        driver.scopes = [
            '.*stackoverflow.*',
            '.*github.*'
        ]

        driver.get(...)  # Start making requests

        # Only request URLs containing "stackoverflow" or "github" will now be captured

    Note that even if a request is out of scope and not captured, it will still travel through Selenium Wire.

``seleniumwire_options.disable_capture``
    Use this option to switch off request capture. Requests will still pass through Selenium Wire and through any upstream proxy you have configured but they won't be intercepted or stored. Request interceptors will not execute.

    .. code:: python

        options = {
            'disable_capture': True  # Don't intercept/store any requests
        }
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``seleniumwire_options.exclude_hosts``
    Use this option to bypass Selenium Wire entirely. Any requests made to addresses listed here will go direct from the browser to the server without involving Selenium Wire. Note that if you've configured an upstream proxy then these requests will also bypass that proxy.

    .. code:: python

        options = {
            'exclude_hosts': ['host1.com', 'host2.com']  # Bypass Selenium Wire for these hosts
        }
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``request.abort()``
    You can abort a request early by using ``request.abort()`` from within a `request interceptor`_. This will send an immediate response back to the client without the request travelling any further. You can use this mechanism to block certain types of requests (e.g. images) to improve page load performance.

    .. code:: python

        def interceptor(request):
            # Block PNG, JPEG and GIF images
            if request.path.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.gif')):
                request.abort()

        driver.request_interceptor = interceptor

        driver.get(...)  # Start making requests

.. _`request interceptor`: #intercepting-requests-and-responses

Request Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Captured requests and responses are stored in the system temp folder by default (that's ``/tmp`` on Linux and usually ``C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`` on Windows) in a sub-folder called ``.seleniumwire``. To change where the ``.seleniumwire`` folder gets created you can use the ``request_storage_base_dir`` option:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage_base_dir': '/my/storage/folder'  # .seleniumwire will get created here
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

In-Memory Storage
-----------------

Selenium Wire also supports storing requests and responses in memory only, which may be useful in certain situations - e.g. if you're running short lived Docker containers and don't want the overhead of disk persistence. You can enable in-memory storage by setting the ``request_storage`` option to ``memory``:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage': 'memory'  # Store requests and responses in memory only
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

If you're concerned about the amount of memory that may be consumed, you can restrict the number of requests that are stored with the ``request_storage_max_size`` option:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage': 'memory',
        'request_storage_max_size': 100  # Store no more than 100 requests in memory
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

When the max size is reached, older requests are discarded as newer requests arrive. Keep in mind that if you restrict the number of requests being stored, requests may have disappeared from storage by the time you come to retrieve them with ``driver.requests`` or ``driver.wait_for_request()`` etc.

Proxies
~~~~~~~

If the site you are accessing sits behind a proxy server you can tell Selenium Wire about that proxy server in the options you pass to the webdriver.

The configuration takes the following format:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'proxy': {
            'http': 'http://192.168.10.100:8888',
            'https': 'https://192.168.10.100:8888',
            'no_proxy': 'localhost,127.0.0.1'
        }
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, specify the username and password in the URL:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'proxy': {
            'https': 'https://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8888',
        }
    }

For authentication other than Basic, you can supply the full value for the ``Proxy-Authorization`` header using the ``custom_authorization`` option. For example, if your proxy used the Bearer scheme:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'proxy': {
            'https': 'https://192.168.10.100:8888',  # No username or password used
            'custom_authorization': 'Bearer mytoken123'  # Custom Proxy-Authorization header value
        }
    }

More info on the ``Proxy-Authorization`` header can be found `here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Proxy-Authorization>`__.

The proxy configuration can also be loaded through environment variables called ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY``:

.. code:: bash

    $ export HTTP_PROXY="http://192.168.10.100:8888"
    $ export HTTPS_PROXY="https://192.168.10.100:8888"
    $ export NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1"

SOCKS
-----

Using a SOCKS proxy is the same as using an HTTP based one but you set the scheme to ``socks5``:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'proxy': {
            'http': 'socks5://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8888',
            'https': 'socks5://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8888',
            'no_proxy': 'localhost,127.0.0.1'
        }
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

You can leave out the ``user`` and ``pass`` if your proxy doesn't require authentication.

As well as ``socks5``, the schemes ``socks4`` and ``socks5h`` are supported. Use ``socks5h`` when you want DNS resolution to happen on the proxy server rather than on the client.

**Using Selenium Wire with Tor**

See `this example <https://gist.github.com/woswos/38b921f0b82de009c12c6494db3f50c5>`_ if you want to run Selenium Wire with Tor.

Switching Dynamically
---------------------

If you want to change the proxy settings for an existing driver instance, use the ``driver.proxy`` attribute:

.. code:: python

    driver.get(...)  # Using some initial proxy

    # Change the proxy
    driver.proxy = {
        'https': 'https://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8888',
    }

    driver.get(...)  # These requests will use the new proxy

To clear a proxy, set ``driver.proxy`` to an empty dict ``{}``.

This mechanism also supports the ``no_proxy`` and ``custom_authorization`` options.

Bot Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selenium Wire will integrate with `undetected-chromedriver`_ if it finds it in your environment. This library will transparently modify ChromeDriver to prevent it from triggering anti-bot measures on websites.

.. _`undetected-chromedriver`: https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver

If you wish to take advantage of this make sure you have undetected_chromedriver installed:

.. code:: bash

    pip install undetected-chromedriver

Then in your code, import the ``seleniumwire.undetected_chromedriver`` package:

.. code:: python

    import seleniumwire.undetected_chromedriver as uc

    chrome_options = uc.ChromeOptions()

    driver = uc.Chrome(
        options=chrome_options,
        seleniumwire_options={}
    )


Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selenium Wire uses it's own root certificate to decrypt HTTPS traffic. It is not normally necessary for the browser to trust this certificate because Selenium Wire tells the browser to add it as an exception. This will allow the browser to function normally, but it will display a "Not Secure" message (and/or unlocked padlock) in the address bar. If you wish to get rid of this message you can install the root certificate manually.

You can download the root certificate `here <https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire/raw/master/seleniumwire/ca.crt>`__. Once downloaded, navigate to "Certificates" in your browser settings and import the certificate in the "Authorities" section.

Using Your Own Certificate
--------------------------

If you would like to use your own root certificate you can supply the path to the certificate and the private key using the ``ca_cert`` and ``ca_key`` options.

If you do specify your own certificate, be sure to manually delete Selenium Wire's `temporary storage folder <#request-storage>`_. This will clear out any existing certificates that may have been cached from previous runs.

All Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

A summary of all options that can be passed to Selenium Wire via the ``seleniumwire_options`` webdriver attribute.

``addr``
    The IP address or hostname of the machine running Selenium Wire. This defaults to 127.0.0.1. You may want to change this to the public IP of the machine (or container) if you're using the `remote webdriver`_.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'addr': '192.168.0.10'  # Use the public IP of the machine
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

.. _`remote webdriver`: #creating-the-webdriver

``auto_config``
    Whether Selenium Wire should auto-configure the browser for request capture. ``True`` by default.

``ca_cert``
    The path to a root (CA) certificate if you prefer to use your own certificate rather than use the default.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'ca_cert': '/path/to/ca.crt'  # Use own root certificate
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``ca_key``
    The path to the private key if you're using your own root certificate. The key must always be supplied when using your own certificate.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'ca_key': '/path/to/ca.key'  # Path to private key
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``disable_capture``
    Disable request capture. When ``True`` nothing gets intercepted or stored. ``False`` by default.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'disable_capture': True  # Don't intercept/store any requests.
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``disable_encoding``
    Ask the server to send back uncompressed data. ``False`` by default. When ``True`` this sets the ``Accept-Encoding`` header to ``identity`` for all outbound requests. Note that it won't always work - sometimes the server may ignore it.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'disable_encoding': True  # Ask the server not to compress the response
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``enable_har``
    When ``True`` a HAR archive of HTTP transactions will be kept which can be retrieved with ``driver.har``. ``False`` by default.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'enable_har': True  # Capture HAR data, retrieve with driver.har
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``exclude_hosts``
    A list of addresses for which Selenium Wire should be bypassed entirely. Note that if you have configured an upstream proxy then requests to excluded hosts will also bypass that proxy.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'exclude_hosts': ['google-analytics.com']  # Bypass these hosts
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``ignore_http_methods``
    A list of HTTP methods (specified as uppercase strings) that should be ignored by Selenium Wire and not captured. The default is ``['OPTIONS']`` which ignores all OPTIONS requests. To capture all request methods, set ``ignore_http_methods`` to an empty list:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'ignore_http_methods': []  # Capture all requests, including OPTIONS requests
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``port``
    The port number that Selenium Wire's backend listens on. You don't normally need to specify a port as a random port number is chosen automatically.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'port': 9999  # Tell the backend to listen on port 9999 (not normally necessary to set this)
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``proxy``
    The upstream `proxy server <https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire#proxies>`__ configuration if you're using a proxy.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'proxy': {
            'http': 'http://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8888',
            'https': 'https://user:pass@192.168.10.100:8889',
            'no_proxy': 'localhost,127.0.0.1'
        }
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``request_storage``
    The type of storage to use. Selenium Wire defaults to disk based storage, but you can switch to in-memory storage by setting this option to ``memory``:

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage': 'memory'  # Store requests and responses in memory only
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``request_storage_base_dir``
    The base location where Selenium Wire stores captured requests and responses when using its default disk based storage. This defaults to the system temp folder (that's ``/tmp`` on Linux and usually ``C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`` on Windows). A sub-folder called ``.seleniumwire`` will get created here to store the captured data.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage_base_dir': '/my/storage/folder'  # .seleniumwire will get created here
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``request_storage_max_size``
    The maximum number of requests to store when using in-memory storage. Unlimited by default. This option currently has no effect when using the default disk based storage.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'request_storage': 'memory',
        'request_storage_max_size': 100  # Store no more than 100 requests in memory
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``suppress_connection_errors``
    Whether to suppress connection related tracebacks. ``True`` by default, meaning that harmless errors that sometimes occur at browser shutdown do not alarm users. When suppressed, the connection error message is logged at DEBUG level without a traceback. Set to ``False`` to allow exception propagation and see full tracebacks.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'suppress_connection_errors': False  # Show full tracebacks for any connection errors
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)

``verify_ssl``
    Whether SSL certificates should be verified. ``False`` by default, which prevents errors with self-signed certificates.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'verify_ssl': True  # Verify SSL certificates but beware of errors with self-signed certificates
    }
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(seleniumwire_options=options)
